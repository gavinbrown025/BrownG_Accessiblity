Good morning today, we are
talking about romance languages.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.460
Any news you want to share?

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.160
Eight hours after landing.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.140
There still no signs of first contact, the
objects measure at least 1500 feet tall.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.970
What's going to happen.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.870
I don't know.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.220
More objects like this have
landed around the world.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.060
Dr.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.360
Banks.

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:27.220
I'm Colonel Weber.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.840
You're on the top of everyone's list.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.050
When it comes to translations, I have
something I need you to translate for me

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.660
is that..

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.200
Not everyone is able to process
experiences like this when's last

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.480
time you did something stressful?.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.290
Does now count?

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.230
We need answers as soon as possible.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:52.390
What do they want?

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:53.500
Where are they from?

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:06.030
Yeah, that just happened.

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.470
We're one of 12, we're a
world with no single leader.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.089
It's impossible to deal with.

00:01:21.089 --> 00:01:21.869
Just one of us.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.140
How do we clarify their intentions?

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.160
I go back in, I guess I don't need to
tell you when you put yourself at risk.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.710
That's a proper introduction.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.429
I feel like everything that happens
comes down to the two of us.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.070
I know what it is.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.090
What does it say?

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:44.530
Offer weapon?

00:01:47.839 --> 00:01:50.030
I don't need an interpreter
to know what this means.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.839
We don't know if they understand
the difference between a weapon

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.850
and a tool China just threatened to
destroy their shell, whatever they do.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.450
It's in Korea will follow.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.520
We could be facing global war.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.990
We need to talk to the other sites.

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:10.789
We have 15 hours before
this all goes down.

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:14.299
Are you dreaming in their language?

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.279
I know why they're here.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.679
What the hell is she doing?
